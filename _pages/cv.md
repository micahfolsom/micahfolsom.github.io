Experience
---------
**Senior Scientific Engineering Associate, LBNL Applied Nuclear Physics**
(Jan 2021-current)
- Software and hardware development for radiation detector systems that
combine sophisticated radiation imaging algorithms with 2/3D spatial data
(RGBD, LiDAR, etc) to produce 3D models with quantitative radiation dose
information.
- Application spaces (primarily) include nuclear safeguards/security and
emergency response.

**Graduate Research Assistant, University of Tennessee, Knoxville**
(Aug 2014-Nov 2020)
- Developed an electronic signal generation model using C++ and ANSYS
Maxwell for semiconductor radiation sensors, then validated the model with
experimental measurements.
- Created a statistical radiation transport simulation that employed open
source C++ libraries (Geant4) to model an instrument on the Curiosity
rover used to detect subsurface water on Mars.
- Designed a novel, compact, fast neutron camera by creating three
designs, selecting the best performer based on simulations, then
optimizing the sensor geometry.
- Developed a set of multithreaded analysis tools and data pipelines to
parse, clean, sort, filter, analyze, and visualize ~10s of TB of both
simulated and experimental data.
- Built a lab prototype of the neutron camera, wrote Qt-based C++ software
to automate the characterization measurements, and experimentally
demonstrated the neutron imaging capability of the instrument.
- Collaborated with scientists from across the country who were developing
different designs of the same type of sensor and who were performing
detailed characterization measurements of the anticipated sensor
components.

**Intern, Pacific Northwest National Lab, Richland, WA**
(May-Aug 2016)
- Created data acquisition software (C++/Qt) to read, store, and visualize
data in real time from a prototype radiation counting system used for
nuclear safeguards and treaty verification.
- Developed digital signal processing algorithms suitable for high
radiation rates (>1 MHz), which were implemented on an FPGA.

**Intern, International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, Austria**
(Jun-Aug 2014)
- Used MATLAB Simulink to develop and test an FPGA digital signal
processing algorithm for high dose rate radiation sensor applications.
- Developed statistical radiation transport software (C++) to model a
portable radiation sensor being considered for use by international
inspectors.

**Research Assistant, University of California, Berkeley, CA**
(Mar 2010-Jun 2014)
- Constructed an instrument to rapidly perform detailed characterization
of large semiconductor radiation sensors.
- Assisted with the fabrication and quality control of radiation sensors
deployed for experiments by NASA.
